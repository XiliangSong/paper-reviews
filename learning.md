  - Learn foreign language vocabulary pairs (e.g., Swahili-English mashua-boat), -> +study+test, -study+test, +study-test, -study-test -> final test
  - Proportion recalled = +study+test (80%), -study+test (80%), +study-test (36%), -study-test (33%)
  - Repeated testing (retrieval of learned information) produced a large positive effect, while repeated studying has no benefit.
  - Wrong conventional wisdom: once information can be recalled from memory it can be dropped from further practice

  - The ubiquitous "power law of practice" (log-log linear learning law) - holds for practice learning of all kinds
    - Show 12 examples, including mirror-tracing (Snoddy 1926) - time + errors decrease as trials increase ( T = BN^(-alpha) where alpha is the learning rate)
  - the chunking theory of learning
