  - Success of lexicalized PCFG models (e.g., Charniak 1997, Collins 1999)
  - Johnson (1998) unlexicalized PCFG could be improved by annotating each node by its parent category (e.g., subject NP is 8.7 times more likely than an object NP to expand as just a pronoun)
  - Collins (1999) hand engineerred subcategorizations e.g., differenciating base-NPs, sentences with empty subjects
  - Generalization of parent annotation and markovization - only the past v vertical ancestors matter, only the previous h horizontal ancestors matter -> best results when v = 3 and h â‰¤ 2
  - Annotation: UNARY-INTERNAL marks any nonterminal node which has only one child. UNARY-DT marks splits, TAG-PA marks all preterminals with their their parent category
  - Unlexicailzed grammar - e.g., functional words and content words - PP[to] -> OK, NP[stocks] -> NG
  - Annotations already in the treebank - PP-LOC or ADVP-TMP have negative utility, TMP-NP positive
  - Head annotation e.g., SPLIT-VP annotates all VP nodes with their head tag.
